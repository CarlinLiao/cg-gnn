# Quantifying Explainers of Graph Neural Networks in Computational Pathology

This repository includes the code for replicating results presented in the paper [Quantifying Explainers of Graph Neural Networks in Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.12646.pdf) presented at CVPR 2021.  

The code mostly relies on the [`histocartography`](https://github.com/histocartography/histocartography) library, a python-based package for modeling and learning with graph-based representations of pathology images. 

All the experiments are based on the BRACS dataset. The data needs to be downloaded separately (see Installation steps).

## Installation 

### Cloning and handling ependencies 

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/histocartography/patho-quant-explainer.git && cd patho-quant-explainer
```

Create a conda environment and activate it:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pathoexplainer
```

Make sure that you have the latest version of histocartography, `histocartography==0.2`.

### Downloading the BRACS dataset 

BRACS is a dataset of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) histopathological images for automated detection/classification of breast tumors. BRACS includes >4k tumor regions-of-interest labeled in 7 categories (Normal, Benign, UDH, ADH, FEA, DCIS, Invasive). 

In order to download the BRACS dataset, you need to create an account [there](https://www.bracs.icar.cnr.it/). Then, go to `Data Collection`, `Download`, and hit the `Regions of Interest Set` button to access the data. Download the `v1` data. The data are stored on an FTP server. 

## Running the code 

The proposed approach for explainability of histology images is based on 3 steps: cell graph generation, post-hoc graph explaination to identify salient nodes and, quantitative analysis. 

### Step 1: Cell graph generation 

Each image needs to be transformed into a cell graph where nodes represent nuclei and edges nuclei-nuclei interactions. The cell graph for the BRACS test set can be generated with: 

```
cd core
python generate_cell_graphs.py --data_path <PATH-TO-BRACS>/BRACS/test/ --save_path <SOME-SAVE-PATH>/quant-gnn-explainers-data
```

The script will automatically create a directory containing a cell graph as a `.bin` file for each image. There should be 626 files created. 

### Step 2: Explaining the cell graphs

We benchmark 4 different explainers: GraphLRP, GNNExplainer, GraphGradCAM and GraphGradCAM++, that returns a different explanation, i.e., nuclei-level importance scores, for each cell graph. The system will automatically download a pre-trained checkpoint trained on 3-class BRACS. This model reaches 74% accuracy on the test set. 

Generating explanation with:

```
python generate_explanations --cell_graphs <SOME-SAVE-PATH>/quant-gnn-explainers-data/cell_graphs --explainer graphgradcam --save_path <SOME-SAVE-PATH>/quant-gnn-explainers-data/graphgradcam
```

The explainer type can be set to either: `graphgradcam`, `graphgradcampp`, `gnnexplainer` or `graphlrp`. 

### (Step 2-bis: Visualizing the explanation)

We provide a script to visualize the explanation by overlaying the node-level importance scores on the original image. For instance by running:

```
python visualize_explanations --cell_graphs <SOME-SAVE-PATH>/quant-gnn-explainers-data/cell_graphs --images <SOME-SAVE-PATH>/quant-gnn-explainers-data/images --importance_scores <SOME-SAVE-PATH>/quant-gnn-explainers-data/graphgradcam
 --save_path <SOME-SAVE-PATH>/quant-gnn-explainers-data/visualization
 ```

### Step 3: Quantifying explainers

If you don't wanna re-generate all the cell graphs and explanations for the whole set, we provide a zip file that you can directly download [here](https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/412lfz992djt8u6bgu13y9cj9qsurwui.zip). This file contains pre-processed cell graphs and explanations. 

To run the quantitative analysis, you can simply run:

```
python run_qualitative_analysis.py --cell_graphs <SOME-SAVE-PATH>/quant-gnn-explainers-data/cell_graphs --importance_scores <SOME-SAVE-PATH>quant-gnn-explainers-data/graphgradcam --save_path <SOME-SAVE-PATH>/visualization/graphgradcam
```

The code will save a number of histograms that represent the distribution of nuclei-level attributes per tumor type. The code also print the separability scores: average, maximum and correlation. 

Note: The code will by default remove misclassified samples, it is also possible to run on the entire test set by adding the flag `misclassification` (see implementation for details). 

An example of attribute histograms would be:

### Disclaimer: 

A number of elements changed in the pipeline explaining different numbers than the ones reported in the original paper. However, the conclusion remains. The differences include a different nuclei detector, an optimized stain normalization, a different list of nuclei-level attributes (changed to reduce computational requirements), a more robust attribute normalization.
